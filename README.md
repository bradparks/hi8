# hi8

Tools for making animations from Himawari-8 P-Tree data.

This is the workflow I’m using for new https://glittering.blue movies.

Code here is late alpha quality at best! Documentation is probably wrong!

## Prerequisites

To use this you’ll want roughly these system packages:

- libHDF5
- imagemagick (:/)

These python libraries:

- rasterio
- netCDF

And [rayg’s `himawari`](https://gitlab.ssec.wisc.edu/rayg/himawari).

## Running the code

Who knows?
